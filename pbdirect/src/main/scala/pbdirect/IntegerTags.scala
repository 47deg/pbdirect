/**
 * A modifier to signify that an integer field is encoded as a signed Protobuf type
 * (sint32, sint64, sfixed32 or sfixed64).
 *
 * This modifier is used by attaching it to a field's type as a shapeless tag.
 * e.g.
 *
 * {{{
 * import shapeless.tag.@@
 * import pbdirect.Signed
 *
 * case class MyMessage(
 *   signedInt: Int @@ Signed,  // will be encoded as an sint32
 *   signedLong: Long @@ Signed // will be encoded as an sint64
 * )
 * }}}
 *
 * It can also be combined with the [[Fixed]] tag, e.g.
 *
 * {{{
 * case class MyMessage(
 *   fixedSignedInt: Int @@ (Signed with Fixed),  // will be encoded as an sfixed32
 *   fixedSignedLong: Long @@ (Signed with Fixed) // will be encoded as an sfixed64
